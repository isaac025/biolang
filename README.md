# BioLang
A language for Bioinformatics


## TODO
- [ ] Read: Category Theory by Steve Awodey: In order to understand Remy's paper
- [ ] Read: Write You a Haskell tutorial by Stephen Diehl: In order to understand
  how to use parsec and other Haskell libraries for languages
- [ ] Implement: Start with a simple language that can do: 

        1. Basic Programming Language Constructs:
            a. Number and arithmetic
            b. Boolean and logic
            c. Conditionals and loops
            d. Variables

        2. Sequence Manipulation:
            a. Reverse Complement: Function to compute the reverse complement of a DNA sequence.
            b. Transcription: Convert a DNA sequence to its corresponding RNA sequence.
            c. Translation: Translate an RNA sequence into a protein sequence using a codon table.

        3. Sequence Analysis:
            a. GC Content: Calculate the GC content (percentage of G and C nucleotides) of a sequence.
            b. Length Calculation: Compute the length of a given sequence.
            c. Nucleotide Count: Count occurrences of each nucleotide (A, T, C, G) in a sequence.

        4. Searching:
            a. Pattern Matching: Search for a specific nucleotide or protein pattern within a sequence.
